          <span class="font-bold">Gift Steak House</span> is a name of this
          website project. All the menu in this website is borrowed from
          <span class="font-bold">American Prime Steakhouse</span> and the
          picture at the left side of this article is the restaurant called
          <span class="font-bold">Alvor Steak House</span>.

          My family and I eat beef kinda often this year and I am addicted to
          it. The medium rare beef steak is really a pleasure to see and it con
          melt in your mouth whenever you try it. That's why I choose to come up
          with doing steak house website.

          After spending time creating this website, I think I learnt from it a
          lot. I did some features that I never thought I can do it. I had fun
          messing with this project and it gave me one of the good lesson for
          doing web coding is that I should plan before coding. I have to know
          first about what can be the components, which one I can reuse it.
          Thinking about those things after having web design wireframe is some
          of the best practice for me.

          Anyway, for who you don't know, I create this page after I finished coding every features of this website.
          So everything I wrote in this page came from my true feeling.
          As I said before, I do have fun working with this project and now I am excited about what will be my next project to do. :)
